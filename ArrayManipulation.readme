Array Manipulation
Problem Description
Efficiently handle range updates on an array and find the maximum value after all operations.
Solution Overview
Uses difference array technique to handle range updates in O(1) time, then computes final values.
Data Structure Used

Difference Array: Stores range update deltas
Prefix Sum: Reconstructs final array values

Why This Data Structure is Efficient

O(1) Updates: Constant time range updates
Lazy Evaluation: Defers computation until needed
Memory Efficient: Single array for all operations
Scalable: Handles large number of updates

Algorithm Approach

For each update [a,b,k]: add k at position a, subtract k at position b+1
Compute prefix sum to get final values
Track maximum value during prefix sum computation

Time Complexity

Update Processing: O(m) - m updates
Value Computation: O(n) - n array elements
Total: O(n + m)
Space Complexity: O(n) - Difference array

Mathematical Foundation
Difference array: diff[i] = arr[i] - arr[i-1]
Prefix sum reconstruction: arr[i] = arr[i-1] + diff[i]
