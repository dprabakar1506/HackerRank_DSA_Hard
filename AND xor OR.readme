AND XOR OR
------------
Problem Description
Find maximum value of ((a&b)^(a|b))&(a^b) for all possible pairs in array using stack-based approach.
Solution Overview
Uses a custom stack to maintain elements and computes the expression for valid pairs.
Data Structure Used

Custom Stack: Array-based stack implementation
Array: Input data storage

Why This Data Structure is Efficient

Stack Properties: LIFO for pair processing
Custom Implementation: Tailored operations
Efficient Computation: Avoids redundant calculations
Memory Management: Controlled stack operations

Algorithm Approach

Use stack to maintain potential pairs
For each element, compute expression with stack top
Maintain maximum value found
Handle stack operations based on element comparisons

Time Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n) - Each element processed once
Space Complexity: O(n) - Stack storage

Mathematical Foundation
Expression ((a&b)^(a|b))&(a^b) combines bitwise operations for specific value extraction.
