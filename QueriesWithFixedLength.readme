Queries with Fixed Length
--------------------------
Problem Description
For each query, find the minimum of maximum values in all subarrays of given length.
Solution Overview
Uses sliding window maximum with deque for efficient window management.
Data Structure Used

Deque: Maintains potential maximum candidates
Sliding Window: Fixed-size window processing

Why This Data Structure is Efficient

O(1) Window Updates: Constant time window sliding
Deque Properties: Efficient front/back operations
Monotonic Queue: Maintains useful elements only
Minimum Tracking: Finds minimum of maximums

Algorithm Approach

Use deque to maintain maximum candidates for current window
For each window position, store maximum value
Find minimum among all window maximums

Time Complexity

Window Processing: O(n) - Each element processed once
Query Processing: O(n) per query
Space Complexity: O(n) - Deque and result storage
