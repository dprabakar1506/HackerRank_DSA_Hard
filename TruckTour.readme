Truck Tour
Problem Description
Find starting petrol pump for circular tour where truck can complete the circuit.
Solution Overview
Uses queue-based simulation to find valid starting point for circular tour.
Data Structure Used

Queue: Circular processing of petrol pumps
Greedy Approach: Optimal starting point selection

Why This Data Structure is Efficient

Circular Processing: Queue naturally handles circular structure
Single Pass: O(n) time complexity
Greedy Strategy: Optimal starting point identification
Space Efficient: Minimal additional storage

Algorithm Approach

Try each starting position
Simulate tour keeping track of fuel
If insufficient fuel, update starting position
Continue until valid start found

Time Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n) - Each pump visited at most twice
Space Complexity: O(n) - Queue storage

Mathematical Foundation
If solution exists, greedy approach guarantees finding it in single pass by eliminating invalid starting positions.
