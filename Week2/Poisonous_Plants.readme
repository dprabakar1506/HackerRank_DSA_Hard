Poisonous Plants
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem Description
------------------------
Plants in a line die daily if they have more pesticide than the plant to their left. 
Find how many days until no more plants die (array becomes non-decreasing).

Solution Overview
---------------------
Use stack to track when each plant dies without day-by-day simulation. Process plants right-to-left, calculating death days based on plants that can kill them.

Data Structures Used
-----------------------
Stack: Stores (pesticide_value, death_day) pairs
Monotonic Stack: Maintains decreasing pesticide order
Reverse Traversal: Process from right to left for efficiency

Why These Data Structures are Efficient
---------------------------------------------
Stack Operations: O(1) push/pop for plant processing
Single Pass: Each plant pushed and popped at most once
Avoids Simulation: Calculates final result without day-by-day steps

Algorithm Approach
------------------------
Process plants from right to left
For each plant:

Pop weaker plants from stack (those it can kill)
Calculate when current plant dies based on remaining stack
Track maximum death day
Push current plant to stack

Return maximum death day encountered

Time Complexity
-----------------------
Time Complexity: O(N) - Each plant processed once
Space Complexity: O(N) - Stack storage
